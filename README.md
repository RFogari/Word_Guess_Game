# Word_Guess_Game
This project was to create a word guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this game is to correctly identify the Presidents featured on the U.S. paper currency.
The Presidents are radomly selected and identified by their last name.
Using your keyboard, select a letter A through Z.
If you correctly guessed a letter featured in the current last name, the current word string will update with the letter.
If you guessed an incorrect letter, the guesses remaining will decrease by one.
Each game is a round of 10 chances.
Guess correctly and you might win.
Good Luck.
